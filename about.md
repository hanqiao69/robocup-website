The UPennalizers is affiliated with General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and
Perception (GRASP) Laboratory and the School of Engineering and Applied
Science at University of Pennsylvania. In 1999, two years after the first international
RoboCup, this robot soccer team was formed and began stepping up
to the challenges put forth by the competition. While the league was still utilizing
four-legged Sony Aibos, the UPennalizers made the quarterfinal rounds
every year through 2006 before taking a brief two-year hiatus in 2007. The
team reformed and returned in 2009 to begin competing in the Standard Platform
League with Aldebaran Nao robots, taking on bipedal motion alongside
improved vision techniques and advanced behavior control. In 2015, with most
of the team members graduated, a relatively new team was formed to take on
more challenges in recognizing white goal posts, designing coaching robot behaviors
as well as improving the localization and locomotion systems. Coached by
Dr.Daniel Lee, the 2015 team consists of Yizheng (Dickens) He, Yongbo Qian,
Sagar Poudel, Kyu Il Lee, Qiao (Rachel) Han and Austin Small.
